# Ground-Up-UE-Starter-Kit
Ground-Up is a collection of shaders, materials, light functions, templates, and more that can each work in tandem with one another to craft a style that caters to any game developer looking to escape the "Unreal Feel". Ground-Up dabbles in pixelation filters, stylized dithering, cel shading, color depth, outlines, and even a painting shader.
